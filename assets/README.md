## Command Icon

The `command-icon.png` file is currently a placeholder. You need to replace it with an actual PNG icon for your Raycast extension.

### Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Minimum Size**: 512x512 pixels (recommended)
- **Design**: Should represent the concept of merging/unpacking files
- **Style**: Should match Raycast's design language (simple, clean, recognizable)

### Icon Ideas

Consider these design concepts:
- A ZIP file with an arrow pointing to a folder
- Overlapping folders merging into one
- A package/box being unpacked
- Multiple files converging into a single folder

### Tools for Creating Icons

- **Figma**: Free vector design tool
- **Sketch**: Professional design tool (macOS)
- **GIMP**: Free raster graphics editor
- **Photoshop**: Professional raster editor
- **Icon generators**: Search for "app icon generator" online

### Quick Solution

If you need to get started quickly, you can:
1. Use a solid color square as a temporary icon
2. Find a free icon from sites like:
   - https://www.flaticon.com/
   - https://icons8.com/
   - https://www.iconfinder.com/
3. Make sure to check the license before using

### Adding Your Icon

Simply replace this file with your PNG icon:
```bash
# Replace with your icon
cp /path/to/your/icon.png assets/command-icon.png
```

The extension will automatically use the new icon.
